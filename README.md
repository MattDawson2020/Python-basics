## 🐍 Python basics

- Basics taken from [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/)
- After finish makers I felt I could probably learn Python through simply making a project through translation/ documentation, but had already bought it last year so might as well use it
- Initial quiz in course says if you pass 60% you can skip to projects, which I achieved, but I went through it anyway as I had time and wanted to be thorough


## 💭 Thoughts so far

- Python seems to be an excellent language, it posseses much (or even more) of the concise/simplciity of syntax 
- Unlike Ruby the syntactic sugar doesn't seem to tradeoff capabilities, it's high utility but with none of the 'quirks' of other languages so far
- Indent block syntax is far more readable and obvious than {} or even Ruby do/end
